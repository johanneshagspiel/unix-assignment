# Unix Assignment

This repository contains a full raytracer that was created in C++ and uses [Tucano](https://www.lcg.ufrj.br/tucano/) as a OpenGL wrapper to create from a virtual scene a static image. 

## Features

This full raytracer:

- performs ray intersections with planes, triangles, and bounding boxes.
- computates shading at the first impact point (diffuse and specular).
- performs recursive raytracing for re ections to simulate specular materials.
- calculates hard shadows from a point light.
- calculates soft shadows from a spherical light centered at a point light.
- has a simple acceleration structure.
